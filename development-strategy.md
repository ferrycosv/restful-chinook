# RESTFUL-CHINOOK: development strategy

---

## 0. Setup

- Cloned repository and installed all dependencies, tested existing routes and identified the parts of code to implement the CRUD operations.

---

## 1. User Story: `CRUD operations track table`

- User must be able to perform any CRUD operation to the SQLite database using REST  API commands, the server must process the request and give back a response and status "ok" or and status "error" with a message.
- The file `./api/tracks/controller.js` add the functionalities to process incoming HTTP requests and execute the CRUD operation.
